The Birth of a Universe (According to FAT)

1. Star Death
A massive star collapses under its own gravity and dies.


2. Black Hole Formation
The collapse creates a singularity — a perfect point of symmetry containing compressed matter.


3. Gravitational Pull Initiates Curvature
The intense gravity curves the surrounding structure, pulling matter and time inward.


4. 2D Plane Emerges Inside the Singularity
Inside the black hole, a 2D perfectly symmetrical plane is formed — motionless, filled with evenly distributed matter. Time is not yet present inside.


5. Time Touches the Plane
The infinite, one-directional field of time reaches the 2D void from outside — not with force, but with presence, like water touching still paper.


6. Awareness is Born
The touch of time awakens awareness from within the matter. Awareness is not external but latent, and its activation causes:


7. The Bridge Forms
Awareness creates three simultaneous connections:

Between Time and Matter

Between Matter and Itself

Between Itself and Time



8. Entropy and Distinction Emerge
This instant of bridging causes the first asymmetry: entropy rises from zero, and reality begins.


9. Gravity Distorts the 2D Plane into 3D Space
The presence of distinction and entropy induces gravitational curvature, birthing 3D structure.


10. Motion, Complexity, and Causality Follow
From here, the universe unfolds — driven by time, difference, and recursive structure.


11. The Emergence of Motion
When distinction formed and entropy rose, awareness appeared — and so did gravity.
In this emergent universe, matter was initially distributed evenly across the 2D plane. But now, the smallest speck of matter has gravitational pull.
These specks begin to attract each other. Since there’s no true “empty” space between them, they naturally form clumps, which grow over time.
These clumps compress, increase mass, and generate stronger gravitational fields.
With no friction in the void, motion continues indefinitely. The result is a universe that becomes increasingly emptier of matter—but more curved and dense in structure.
Thus stars, planets, galaxies, and complexity emerge.
