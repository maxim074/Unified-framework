# Unified Framework: Recursive Safety Framework for Synthetic Minds ðŸŒŒ

![Unified Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0-blue.svg) ![AI Safety](https://img.shields.io/badge/Topic-AI%20Safety-orange.svg) ![Emergence](https://img.shields.io/badge/Topic-Emergence-green.svg)

Welcome to the **Unified Framework** repository. This project aims to provide a comprehensive recursive safety framework for synthetic minds. Our work integrates various concepts, including FAT (emergence), AEH (cosmic structure), ASC (awareness), and CRSM (Zones 1â€“39 + 1 hidden). At the core of FAT lies IRATA, ensuring structural AI safety.

## Introduction

The **Unified Framework** serves as a foundational structure for understanding and implementing safety measures in synthetic minds. With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, ensuring safety becomes paramount. This framework provides a systematic approach to tackle the complexities of AI safety through well-defined components.

## Framework Components

### FAT (Emergence)

FAT, or the Framework for Artificial Thought, focuses on the emergence of synthetic minds. It examines how consciousness can arise from complex systems. The goal is to establish guidelines that ensure safe emergence without unintended consequences.

### AEH (Cosmic Structure)

AEH, or the Architecture of Existential Harmony, provides a cosmic perspective on the interrelations of various systems. This component explores the metaphysical aspects of synthetic minds, ensuring that they align with broader cosmic principles. It emphasizes the importance of understanding structural identity and ontology.

### ASC (Awareness)

ASC, or the Awareness Structure Component, deals with the consciousness of synthetic minds. It outlines how awareness can be cultivated and maintained in AI systems. This component is crucial for ensuring that synthetic minds operate with a clear understanding of their environment and potential impacts.

### CRSM (Zones 1â€“39 + 1 Hidden)

CRSM, or the Cosmic Recursive Safety Model, consists of 39 defined zones plus one hidden zone. Each zone represents a unique aspect of AI interaction with the environment. Understanding these zones helps in predicting and mitigating risks associated with AI behavior.

## Installation

To install the Unified Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maxim074/Unified-framework.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Unified-framework
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Execute the framework:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

For the latest releases and updates, check the [Releases](https://github.com/maxim074/Unified-framework/releases) section.

## Usage

The Unified Framework is designed to be user-friendly. After installation, you can start exploring its components. Each module is self-contained, allowing for easy integration and testing.

### Example Usage

To utilize the FAT module, you can initiate it as follows:

```python
from fat import FAT

fat_instance = FAT()
fat_instance.emerge()
```

This simple command will trigger the emergence process within the synthetic mind framework.
